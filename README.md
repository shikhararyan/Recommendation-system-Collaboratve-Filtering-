# Collaborative Filtering based Recommendation System

ðŸ“š This notebook implements a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system for book recommendations. It analyzes user-item interactions to suggest books that users might be interested in, thus enhancing personalized user experiences in the domain of book recommendation.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this notebook includes information about books, users, and ratings. It consists of the following files:

- `Books.csv`: Contains information about books such as ISBN, title, author, publication year, and publisher.
- `Users.csv`: Includes information about users such as user ID, location, and age.
